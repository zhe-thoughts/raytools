# Github Analyzer

This directory contains a collection of Ray programs to analyze Github repos.

1. `github_stargazers.py` currently hardcodes the Ray project, and generates a 
file containing the location of stargazers (if provided). To use, open the 
Python file and add your Github access token at the line `token = 'token xxxxx'`
